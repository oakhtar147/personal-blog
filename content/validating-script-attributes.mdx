# Validating attributes passed to a script running in the browser

We use `<script />` tags to inject JavaScript code that runs on the browser.
In some cases, we need to externally pass data to a script when it is being initialised and executed.
Here's how to pass data and then validate it inside the script.

### A/B TestingÂ Example

Imagine you have a script called ab-testing.js that is responsible for enabling one of two feature correlated flows within your application.
We can expect a data- attribute which will determine which feature to show. For example:

```html
<script src="./ab-testing.js" data-variant="a"></script>
```

It is now important that any client consuming your script passes the `data-variant` exactly either `a` or `b`.
So within the entry-point of your script, you can validate that.

```ts
function getFeatureVariantOrThrow() {
  const script = document.currentScript
  const variant = script?.getAttribute("data-variant")

  if (!variant) {
    throw new Error("Please pass a data-variant attribute to the script tag")
  }

  if (["a", "b"].includes(variant)) {
    return variant
  }

  throw new Error(
    'Invalid value for data-variant. Please pass either "a" or "b"'
  )
}

const variant = getFeatureVariantOrThrow()
```

With this, any application that uses your script in their
`<head />` will need to provide the correct data-variant as well.
If not, they'll see an error in the browser console:

![Browser Error](/validating-script-attributes/error.png "Browser displaying the error that our script throws")

### Summary

In this short article, we discussed a very specific use case of passing data- attributes to scripts and then validating them within the script.
