Local storage is a good place used commonly to store data (not auth tokens though!) that needs to be persisted between sessions.

You can conveniently store user preferences like a collapsed or expanded sidebar in local storage. However, updates wonâ€™t sync across multiple tabs. To solve this, use the useSyncExternalStore hook in React to ensure consistent data across tabs.

From the [official docs](https://react.dev/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore):

> useSyncExternalStore is a React Hook that lets you subscribe to an external store.

In our context, the external store refers to local storage. useSyncExternalStore allows us to bridge the gap between React and local storage by subscribing a component to local storage.
